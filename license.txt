GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE

Version 3, 29 June 2007

Copyright © 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
Preamble

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works.

The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to your programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users' and authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.

Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users' freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.

Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.



TERMS AND CONDITIONS


0. Definitions.

“This License” refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

“Copyright” also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.

“The Program” refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. Each licensee is addressed as “you”. “Licensees” and “recipients” may be individuals or organizations.

To “modify” a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a “modified version” of the earlier work or a work “based on” the earlier work.

A “covered work” means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program.

To “propagate” a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.

To “convey” a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

An interactive user interface displays “Appropriate Legal Notices” to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.


1. Source Code.

The “source code” for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. “Object code” means any non-source form of a work.

A “Standard Interface” means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers working in that language.

The “System Libraries” of an executable work include anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form. A “Major Component”, in this context, means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.

The “Corresponding Source” for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities. However, it does not include the work's System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work.

The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.

The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.


2. Basic Permissions.

All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.

Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.


3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.

When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.


4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.


5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    * a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a relevant date.
    * b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this License and any conditions added under section 7. This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to “keep intact all notices”.
    * c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.
    * d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so.

A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an “aggregate” if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.


6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:

    * a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange.
    * b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.
    * c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b.
    * d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.
    * e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d.

A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the object code work.

A “User Product” is either (1) a “consumer product”, which means any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a particular user, “normally used” refers to a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product.

“Installation Information” for a User Product means any methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made.

If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).

The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network may be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the network.

Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.


7. Additional Terms.

“Additional permissions” are terms that supplement the terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions.

When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:

    * a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or
    * b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or
    * c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as different from the original version; or
    * d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors of the material; or
    * e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or
    * f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors.

All other non-permissive additional terms are considered “further restrictions” within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.

If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.

Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way.


8. Termination.

You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11).

However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.

Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.


9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.


10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

An “entity transaction” is a transaction transferring control of an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.

You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.


11. Patents.

A “contributor” is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus licensed is called the contributor's “contributor version”.

A contributor's “essential patent claims” are all patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version. For purposes of this definition, “control” includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.

Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version.

In the following three paragraphs, a “patent license” is any express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To “grant” such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.

If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream recipients. “Knowingly relying” means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid.

If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.

A patent license is “discriminatory” if it does not include within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.

Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.


12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.


13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the combination as such.


14. Revised Versions of this License.

The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License “or any later version” applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.

Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.


15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.


16. Limitation of Liability.

IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.


17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.

允许每个人复制和发布这一许可证原始文档的副本，但更改它是不允许的。
前言

GNU通用公共许可证是软件和其他种类作品的自由，copyleft的许可。

在大多数软件许可证和其他实用的工程设计用以剥夺你的自由共享和修改的作品。相比之下，GNU通用公共许可证是为了保证你的自由共享和更改所有版本的程序 - 以确保它仍然是其所有用户的免费软件。我们，自由软件基金会，使用GNU通用公共许可证的大多数我们的软件;它也适用于由其作者以这种方式发布的任何其他工作。你可以把它应用到你的程序中。

当我们在谈论自由软件时，我们指的是自由，而不是价格。我们的通用公共许可证旨在确保您可以自由（如果你愿意，并负责为他们）发布自由软件的副本，您收到的源代码，也可以得到它，如果你想要的话，你可以改变软件或将它的一部分用于新的自由软件，并且确保你知道你能做这些事情。

为了保障您的权利，我们需要禁止任何人否认您的权利，或者要求你放弃这些权利。因此，你有一定的责任，如果你发布软件的副本，或者如果您对其进行修改：责任，尊重他人的自由。

例如，如果你发布这样一个程序的副本，无论是免费的还是收费的，你必须传递到收件人您收到同样的自由。你必须确保他们也能收到或得到源代码。你必须向他们展示这些条款，让他们知道自己的权利。

使用GNU GPL采取两项措施来保护你的权利，开发商：（1）声明软件的版权;（2）给你提供许可证给你复制，分发和/或修改的法律许可。

对于开发者和作者的保护，在GPL清楚地说明，没有任何担保责任的免费软件。为用户和作者的缘故，GPL要求修改版本被标记为已更改，从而使他们的问题将不会被错误地归因于先前版本的作者。

某些设备被设计成拒绝用户访问安装或运行它们内部的软件的修改版本，虽然制造商可以这样做。这是与保护用户自由改变软件的目的根本不相容。这种滥用的系统模式出现在产品为个人使用面积，而这恰恰是它是最不能接受的。因此，我们设计了这个版本的GPL，禁止的做法，这些产品。如果此类问题在其他领域大量出现，我们随时准备为需要保护用户的自由，这一规定延伸到了GPL的未来版本的领域。

最后，每个程序由软件专利的威胁。美国不应该允许专利权限制开发和使用软件的通用计算机，但在那些做的，我们希望避免的特殊危险，适用于自由软件专利可能会使其有效专利。为了防止这种情况，GPL保证了专利，不能用来渲染程序不自由。

该“对应源代码”为目标代码形式的工作就是需要产生，安装，以及（对于一个可执行的著作）运行目标代码和修改工作，包括脚本来控制这些活动的全部源代码。然而，它并不包括作品的系统库，通用目的的工具或使用未经修改的执行这些活动，但一般可用的免费程序不是工作的一部分。例如，对应的源代码包括如那些子程序之间亲密的数据通讯或控制流程与工作的源文件相关的接口定义文件，共享库的源代码和动态链接子程序，这项工作是专门设计要求，工作的其他部分。

相应的源代码不需要包含任何用户可以从对应的源代码的其他部分自动再生。

在源代码形式的作品相应的源是同样的工作。


2.基本权限。

被授予版权的程序的期限根据本许可证授予的所有权利，并且是不可撤销的规定规定的条件得到满足。本授权明确的确认您无限的权限运行未经修改的程序。从运行的有盖的工作的输出被包括在本许可仅当输出，由于其内容，构成了盖的工作。本授权承认您正当使用或其他同等的权利，受版权法的规定。

您可以制作，运行，只要您的授权仍然有效传播覆盖的作品，你不达意，没有条件。你可以传达覆盖工程给他人让他们进行修改专门为你，或者为您提供运行这些工程设施的唯一目的，前提是您必须遵守本协议的条款传达了你不控制所有材料版权。那些从而使或运行覆盖工程，你必须这样做完全代表你，在你的指导和控制，禁止他们作出您的版权材料的任何副本以外的地方与你的关系。

在任何其他情况下输送被允许只在以下规定的条件。再许可是不允许的;部10，就没有必要。


3，保护用户合法权益从反规避法。

无覆盖的工作应在履行其根据1996年12月20日或类似的法律禁止或限制等措施规避通过了WIPO版权条约第11条规定的义务的任何适用法律被视为一种有效的技术措施的一部分。

当你传达一个覆盖工作，你放弃禁止技术措施规避这种规避是通过对于覆盖工作，根据本许可行使权利实现程度的任何法律权力，您放弃任何限制操作或修改作为执行，对工作的用户，你的或第三方的合法权益，禁止技术措施规避手段的工作。


4.输送逐字复制。

当你收到它，你可以传达的程序源代码的完整副本，在任何媒体，只要你显着及适当发布的每个复制适当的版权声明;完整保留所有通知，声明本授权以及任何非许可条款添加符合第7适用于代码;完整保留了无担保的所有通知;并给所有收件人此许可证的副本连同计划。

你可以收取任何价格或价格不为每个要传达的副本，你也可以提供收费的支持或担保的保护。


5.输送修改后的源版本。

你可以传达的工作基础上，计划，或修改在程序产生的，在根据第4条的规定源代码的形式，前提是您必须符合以下条件：

    *一）作品必须包含明确的通告说明您修改了它，并给出相应的日期。
    * b）该作品必须附有明确的说明，它发布在本授权以及根据本条例第7添加任何条件这一要求修改了第4节要求“保持所有通知完整”。
    * c）你必须许可的全部工作，作为一个整体，在这个许可的人谁进入藏的副本。因此，该许可证将适用，以及任何适用的第7附加条款，对整个工作，它的所有部分，无论它们是如何包装。本许可证没有给出许可授权任何其他方式工作，但它并不能否定这样的权限，如果你已分别收到。
    * d）如果工作具有交互式用户界面，每个人都必须显示适当的法律通告;但是，如果程序不显示适当的法律通告的交互界面，你的工作不需要让他们这样做。

与其他分离且独立的作品，这是不被覆盖的工作性质的扩展，以及其中涵盖的工作的汇编不与它如结合以形成更大的程序，或存储或分布在卷上媒体，被称为“总”如果编制和相应产生的版权没有用来限制编辑的用户超出了个人作品允许访问或合法权益。在聚合的有盖的工作列入不会导致此许可证适用于聚集体的其他部分。


6.输送非源代码格式。

您可以传达目标代码形式的工作，包括根据第4和第5的条款，前提是你也传达出机器可读的对应的源代码根据本许可的条款，在这些方法之一：

    *一）传达的目标代码，或体现，一个实物产品（包括物理分发介质）的陪同下，对应的源固定持久的物理介质通常用于软件交换。
    * B）传达的目标代码，或体现在，实体产品（包括实体分发介质），伴随着一个书面报价，有效期至少为三年，有效期，只要您提供备件或客户支持该产品的模型，给任何人谁拥有该目标代码的（1）对应的源代码的在产品，覆盖该许可证，通常用于软件交换的耐用的物理介质上，以优惠的价格所有的软件副本没有比你合理的实际执行该输送源，或（2）访问从网络服务器复制对应的源代码不需要任何费用的成本更多。
    * C）传达的目标代码的单个副本的书面报价，以提供对应源的一个副本。这一条款只是偶尔并不能盈利，且仅当您第6B收到的目标代码这样的提议，以协议。
    * D）通过提供对指定地点（免费或付费传达目标代码），并提供在没有进一步的费用通过相同的地方相当于进入到相应的源以同样的方式。您不需要要求接收者复制对应的源与目标代码。如果复制目标代码的地点是网络服务器，对应的源代码可能是一个不同的服务器上（由您或者第三方运作），支持相同复制功能的，只要你保持清晰的方向靠近目标代码说在哪里找到对应的源代码。无论什么样的服务器托管对应的源代码，您都有义务保证它是可用，只要需要满足这些要求。
    * E）传达使用对等网络传输的目标代码，只要你告知那里的工作目标代码和对应的源被提供给广大市民，在根据第6D不收费的其他同行。

目标代码，其源代码被排除在对应的源代码作为系统库，可分离的部分不必包含在传送目标代码的工作。

“用户产品”指（1）“消费品”，这意味着它通常用于个人，家庭，或家庭目的，或（2）任何设计或制造用于掺入销往住宅任何有形动产。在判断一个产品是否是消费品，怀疑案件应当有利于覆盖面来解决。对于由特定用户接收到一特定的产品，“正常使用”指的是不管该特定用户的，其中，特定的用户实际使用的方法或状态到典型的或共同使用该类产品的，或期望或预计使用，该产品。一个产品是一种消费产品，无论该产品是否具有实质的经济，工业和非消费用途，除非该用处是此类产品的使用的唯一显著模式。

“安装信息”为用户产品是指任何方法，程序，授权密钥或其他信息，以安装并从对应源码的修改版本执行在用户产品覆盖程序的修改版本要求。该信息必须足以确保修改后的目标代码的持续运作是在没有妨碍或干扰仅仅因为修改已取得的情况下。

如果在传送的目标代码的工作根据本节中，或与，或特别为在一个用户产品的使用，和输送发生是由于在其中拥有和使用的用户产品的权被转移到一个事务的一部分收件人永久或固定期限（无论交易是如何表征），根据本条所传达的对应的源代码必须附有安装信息。但是，如果您或任何第三方保留在用户产品上安装修改的对象代码（例如，工作已安装在ROM）的能力，这一要求并不适用。

要求提供安装信息不包含要求继续对已修改或安装由收件人，或为用户产品中，它已被修改或安装的工作提供支持服务，担保或更新。当修改本身造成重大不利影响网络的运行，或者违反规则和协议在网络通信访问网络可能会被拒绝。

对应源代码和提供的安装信息，符合本部分必须是在被公开记录（以及可在源代码的形式公开的实施）的格式，而且必须不需要特殊的密码或钥匙开箱，阅读或复制。


7.附加条款。

“其他权限”的条款是由它的一个或多个条件作出例外补充本授权的条款。这是适用于整个项目的额外权限应被视为好像它们是包含在此许可证，以他们根据适用法律的有效程度。如果额外的权限只适用于计划的一部分，也可以单独使用在这些权限的那部分，但整个程序仍然在本许可证的，而不考虑其他权限管辖。

当您发布覆盖工作的一个副本，您可以根据您的选择删除该副本，或任何部分的任何额外的权限。 （附加许可可能要求自己拆除在某些情况下，当你修改工作）。你可能对材料的额外权限，由您加入到有盖的工作，您拥有或能授予版权许可。

尽管有任何其他规定许可的，对物质添加到带盖的工作，你可能（如果授权的材料的版权持有人）补充本授权的条款的条件：

    *一）拒绝担保责任或第15及本授权的16项不同的方式限制责任;或
    * B）要求保留特定的合理法律通告或在物质或含有它的作品显示相应的法律声明作者归属;或
    * c）禁止该材料的来源的误传，或要求，这种材料的修改版本被标记在合理的方式从原始版本不同;或
    * D）限制使用的许可或材料的作者姓名的宣传目的;或
    * E）下降批准使用一些商品名称，商标或服务商标的商标下的法律权利;或
    * f）规定许可和任何人谁输送物料（或它的修改版本）与责任收件人合同假设，这些假设合同直接强加给那些许可和作者不承担任何责任材料作者的赔偿。

所有其他非许可的附加条款都被认为第10.如果你收到它，或任何部分的程序，包括通知，说明它是由本许可证连同长期治理所指“进一步的限制”的为进一步限制，您可以删除该条款。如果一个授权文件包含进一步约束，但是允许再次授权或根据本许可证输送，可以添加到由该授权文件条款的管辖有盖的做工用料，提供了进一步的限制，撑不下去了这样的再次授权或发布。

如果添加条款，有盖的工作符合本节中，你必须将，在相关的源文件，对适用于这些文件或通知，指明在哪里可以找到适用的条款的附加条款的声明。

附加条款，许可或不许可的，可以在单独书面许可的形式规定，或者规定为例外;上述要求适用任何一种方式。


8.终止。

您不得传播或修改覆盖本许可证明确规定的除外。任何试图以其他方式传播或修改是无效的，并将根据本许可（包括根据第11条第三款授予的任何专利许可）自动终止您的权利。

但是，如果您停止违反本许可证，然后从一个特定的版权持有人许可被恢复（一）临时，除非及直至版权持有人明确终于终止您的许可，和（b）永久性地，如果版权持有人失败由前停止后60天某种合理的方式通知违反你。

此外，从一个特定的版权持有人许可被恢复永久如果版权持有人通过某种合理的方式通知违反了你，这是你已经从版权持有人收到违反本许可证的通知（对任何软件）在第一时间，你治好你收到通知后前30天的冲突。

根据本条终止您的权利不会终止根据本许可谁收到副本或权利从你方的许可。如果您的权利已经终止，而不是永久恢复，你没有资格根据第10条收到新的许可证相同的材料。


9.验收不要求具有复制。

你不需要接受本许可证，以便接收或运行本程序的副本。仅作为使用对等网络传输到接收副本同样不需要接受的结果出现的覆盖工作的辅助繁殖。然而，没有什么比这个许可等授权您传播或修改任何覆盖工作。这些行动侵犯版权，如果你不接受本许可证。因此，通过修改或传播覆盖程序，即表明您接受这一许可证这样做。


10.自动许可下游收件人。

每次发布一个覆盖程序时，接受者自动从原始许可接收许可证，运行，修改和传播的工作，受本许可。你是不是负责执行第三方履行与本许可证。

一个“实体交易”是交易传输控制的一个组织，或一个几乎全部资产，或者拆分组织，或者合并组织。如果从实体交易中涉及的工作成果的传播，每一方谁收到作品的复制品也受到任何牌照的兴趣党的前身曾下或上段可以给工作中的事务，加上占有的权利工作从感兴趣的前身对应的源代码，如果前辈有它或能得到它以合理的努力。

您不得在行使本许可授予或确认的权利的任何进一步的限制。例如，您可能不征收执照费，使用费或其他费用行使本许可授予的权利，而你不可以发起诉讼（包括诉讼交叉请求或反诉），声称任何专利主张被侵权通过制造，使用，销售，许诺销售，进口或者在程序或任何部分。


11.专利。

A“贡献者”是著作权人谁下此许可证的程序或者该程序是基于一个作品授权使用。因此行货的工作被称为贡献者的“贡献者版本”。

一个贡献者的“实质的专利申明”是拥有或控制的贡献者，无论已经获得的还是以后取得的所有专利权利要求，将通过某种方式被侵犯，允许这个许可，制造，使用或销售其贡献者版本，但不包括将侵犯只是作为的贡献者版本进一步的修改结果的索赔。在本定义中，“控制”，包括授予与本许可证的要求相一致的方式转让许可证专利的权利。

每个贡献者授予您一个非排他性的，全球的，免版税的专利贡献者的实质的专利权利要求的许可，制造，使用，销售，许诺销售，进口以及运行，修改和传播其贡献者版本内容。

在以下三个自然段中，“专利授权”指任何明示协议或承诺，无论其名称，而不是强制执行的专利（如明确许可实行专利或约定不起诉专利侵权）。以“授予”这样的专利许可的一方手段，使这样的协议或承诺，不强制对当事人的专利。

如果你传达一个覆盖工作，明知依靠专利授权，而作品的相应的源不适用于任何人都可以复制，免费的，根据本许可证的条款，通过一个公开的网络服务器或其他易于接近意味着，你必须（1）使对应的源代码是如此使用，或（2）安排剥夺自己的专利许可的利益为这个特殊的工作，或（3）安排，与一致的方式本许可证的要求，对专利授权延伸到下游的接收者。 “明知靠天吃饭”意味着你的实际知识，但对于专利许可，您传送覆盖工作，在一个国家，或者接收者使用一个国家的覆盖工作，将侵犯一个或多个可识别的专利在该国，你有理由相信它们是有效的。

如果依照或与单交易或安排的连接，你传达，或采购的，有盖的工件输送传播，并授予专利许可给一些当事人接到覆盖工作，允许他们使用，传播，修改或传达覆盖工作的特殊版本，那么你就授予专利权的许可将自动延长到基于它覆盖的工作和作品的所有收件人。

一份专利授权是“有偏见”，如果它不包括其覆盖的范围内，禁止行使，或者条件的非运动之一，即是根据这一授权专门授予的权利或以上。你可能不会发布覆盖的工作，如果你是一方与第三方也就是在发布软件，在你付款到第三方根据您的输送工作的活动程度的业务安排，并根据该第三方拨款，任何一方谁也收到你的工作覆盖，歧视性专利许可（一）与你所传达的覆盖工作的副本（或复印件，从这些副本制作）连接，或（二）主要用于在特定的产品或包含覆盖工作汇编的连接，除非你进入的安排，或者专利许可授予之前，2007年3月28日。

本许可证的任何规定不得解释为排除或限制任何默示许可或其他抗辩侵权，根据适用的专利法，否则可能提供给您。


12.他人的自由没有投降。

如果条件（由法院命令，协议或其他方式是否）表示与本许可证的条件强加给你，他们不从这个许可证的条款为你开脱。如果你不能传达一个涵盖工作，以满足在本许可证及其他相关义务，同时你的义务，那么作为一个结果，你可能无法传达它在所有。例如，如果您同意该条款，你有义务收集费从那些人你传达程序，你可以同时满足这些条件及本授权的将是从输送计划完全避免的唯一途径进一步输送。


13.使用与GNU Affero GPL授权。

尽管有任何其他规定许可的，您有权链接或任何相结合的工作覆盖下的GNU Affero GPL授权的3版本授权到一个单一的综合工作的工作，并传达作品。该许可协议的条款将继续适用于它是覆盖工作的一部分，但GNU Affero GPL授权，第13条，通过网络互动方面的特殊要求将适用于组合本身。


14.修订本授权的版本。

自由软件基金会有时候可能会发布修订和/或GNU通用公共许可证不时新的版本。这样的新版本将会在精神与当前版本类似，但可能会有所不同，详细解决新的问题或疑虑。

每个版本都有不同的版本号。如果程序指定的GNU通用公共许可证“或更新版本”的某编号的版本适用于它，你有以下的条款和条件，或任该编号的版本由自由软件发布的任何版本的选项基金会。如果程序没有指定GNU通用公共许可证的版本号，您可以选择已经出版的自由软件基金会的任何版本。

如果程序指定的代理可以决定哪些可以使用的GNU通用公共许可证的未来版本，接受任何版本的该代理的公开声明永久授权，你可以选择那个版本的程序。

后来许可证版本可能会赋予您额外的或者不同的权限。然而，没有额外的义务强加在任何作者或版权持有者作为选择遵循更高版本的结果。


15.免责声明。

没有担保的方案，在适用法律允许的范围内。除非另有书面说明，版权所有者和/或其他提供程序的人们“一样”不附有任何形式的明示或暗示的保证，包括但不限于适销性和针对特定用途的隐含担保。全部的风险，如程序的质量和性能问题都由你来。如果程序出现缺陷，你承担所有必要的服务，维修或改正的费用。


责任限制16。

在任何情况下，除非适用法律要求或同意以书面形式，任何版权所有者或任何其他一方，修改和/或传达上述许可的程序时，BE不对您的损失，包括任何一般的，特殊的，偶然或必然的因使用或无法破坏使用程序（包括但不限于数据丢失或数据丢失所呈现应由您或第三方或操作带有任何其他程序的程序无法不准确或损失），即使版权所有者和其他人已被告知发生此类损害的可能性。


17.解释第15及16。

如果保修及以上提供的赔偿责任限制的免责条款不能根据自己的条件给予当地法律效力，审查法院应适用当地法律中最接近于完全放弃所有民事赔偿责任与程序的连接，除非保证或假设责任，以换取一定的费用本程序的副本。


最后的条款和条件
